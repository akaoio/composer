title: "Development Principles"
content: |
  When contributing, follow these core principles:
  
  1. **Class = Directory + Method-per-file** - Every class is a directory
  2. **Atomic Documentation** - Each piece of content is a separate YAML file
  3. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, implementation second
  4. **100% Real Implementation** - No mocks, stubs, or placeholder code
  5. **Zero Technical Debt** - Complete every task fully before moving on
  6. **Self-Documenting** - This README is generated using Composer itself!
