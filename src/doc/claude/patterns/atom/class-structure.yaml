title: "Class Structure Pattern"
content: |
  Classes act as containers that import and delegate to method files:
  - index.ts contains only class definition and delegation
  - Each method lives in its own file with full logic
  - Constructor logic in constructor.ts
example: |
  Composer/
    index.ts         # Class container
    constructor.ts   # Constructor logic
    loadData.ts      # loadData() method
    render.ts        # render() method
