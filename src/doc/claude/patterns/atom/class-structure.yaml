pattern: "Classes act as containers that import and delegate to method files"
rules:
  - "index.ts contains only class definition and delegation"
  - "Each method lives in its own file with full logic"
  - "Constructor logic in constructor.ts"
example: |
  Composer/
    index.ts         # Class container
    constructor.ts   # Constructor logic
    loadData.ts      # loadData() method
    render.ts        # render() method
