  requirements:
    - "All code must be tested with @akaoio/battle"
    - "No Jest, Vitest, or external test frameworks"
    - "Real PTY testing for CLI applications"
    - "Write tests BEFORE implementation"
    - "Tests must use actual file I/O, no mocks"
  
  example: |
    import { Battle } from "@akaoio/battle"

      timeout: 30000
