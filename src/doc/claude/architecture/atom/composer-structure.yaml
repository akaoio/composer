title: "Composer Architecture"
content: |
  The Composer project follows strict AKAO.io principles:
  - Each major class (Composer, BuildPipeline, Template) is a directory
  - Methods are individual TypeScript files
  - Imports use .js extension even for .ts files
  - Build outputs to dist/ with CJS, ESM, and types
