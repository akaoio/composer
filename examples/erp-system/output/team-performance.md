### Individual Growth


## Capacity Planning

### Current Capacity
| Level | Members | Average Utilization |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Under-utilized (<70%) | {{#filter agents (lt current_workload.capacity 70)}}{{/filter}} | Can take more work |
| Optimal (70-85%) | {{#filter agents (and (gte current_workload.capacity 70) (lte current_workload.capacity 85))}}{{/filter}} | Well balanced |
| Over-utilized (>85%) | {{#filter agents (gt current_workload.capacity 85)}}{{/filter}} | Risk of burnout |

### Recommendations
1. **Load Balancing**: Redistribute tasks from over-utilized members
2. **Skill Development**: Cross-train team members on critical skills
3. **AI Agent Optimization**: Fine-tune AI agents based on learning logs
4. **Process Improvement**: Reduce handoff times between teams

## Team Health Indicators

### Overall Team Health
- **Morale**: Good (estimated)
- **Collaboration**: Excellent - High cross-team engagement
- **Innovation**: {{#sum agents performance.innovations}}{{/sum}} innovations this period
- **Quality**: Average code quality {{#average agents performance.code_quality}}{{/average}}%

### Risk Areas


## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Address capacity issues for over-utilized team members
2. Resolve blockers affecting sprint velocity
3. Review and optimize AI agent configurations

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. Implement workload balancing automation
2. Enhance cross-team collaboration tools
3. Deploy additional AI agents for high-volume tasks

### Long-term (Next Quarter)
1. Develop comprehensive skill matrix
2. Implement predictive capacity planning
3. Create automated performance optimization system
